# Contributing To Algorithms
### There are **two** ways to start contributing:
### 1. Fork this project.
You can fork this project by clicking the fork button at the top right of this web page.  
**After Forking the Repo, type in these commands to clone the code:**

  git clone https://github.com/YOUR USER NAME/Algorithms.git  
````

### 2. Make a new Branch
Take a look at the current issues. Create a branch to complete or solve that issue, then make a merge request into master.

## Guidelines to Follow
* Always make pull requests to master, not to branches marked as stable.
* If your changes are only refactoring changes, no test are needed.
* New algorithms and bug fixes will require tests. **(NO EXCEPTIONS)**
  * For bug fixes, we require that you provide tests showing the current code failing.
 * Comments should be included so that others can understand how your code works.
